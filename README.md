# Scrappy

Scrappy is a simple, yet efficient, application for Rust and allows users to calculate how much scrap and other resources 
they will get from recycling at different locations such as Safe-Zones and Monuments without the need to guess or keep 
notes written down. **It is open-source to ensure transparency with end-users.**

## Roadmap Ideas

1. Clean up the current theme and create a dark/light mode.
2. Create an idea suggestion feature.
3. Create and handle more items and resources in the JSON file.
